Teaching myself again about Flexbox concepts.

There are two important flexbox elements:

  1. Flexbox Containers
    - Sets the context for the flexbox layout
    - Contains flex items, the actual elements you layout using flexbox
    - Can be block level or inline elements

  2. Flexbox items
    - Every direct child of a flex container
    - There can be any number of items inside a flex container

    Flexbox follows the two axis that determine the layout direction Flex items. Items in a container are laid out following the main axis or the cross axis. Everything in flexbox is relative to these two axis.

    Flexbox Axes
  1. Main Axis
    - The Primary along which flex items are laid out. It defines the direction of the Flex items in the flex container.
  2. Cross Axis
    - This axis runs perpendicular to the main axis.
